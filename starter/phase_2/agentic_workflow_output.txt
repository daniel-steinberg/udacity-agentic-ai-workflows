=== FINAL PROJECT PLAN: EMAIL ROUTER ===

=== USER STORIES ===
As a Customer Support Representative, I want the Email Router system to automate responses to routine inquiries so that I can efficiently address complex customer issues.

As an IT Administrator, I need the Email Router system to seamlessly integrate with our existing email infrastructure to ensure smooth operation and minimal disruption to current workflows.

As a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I expect the Email Router system to accurately route complex inquiries to me based on content analysis so that I can provide specialized assistance promptly and effectively.

As a Team Member, I would like the Email Router system to standardize responses to common inquiries to ensure consistent messaging and information delivery across all customer interactions.

As a Manager, I aim for the Email Router system to reduce the time spent by SMEs and administrative staff on email triage by 70% so that valuable resources can be reallocated to higher-value activities within the organization.

=== ENGINEERING TASKS ===
To align with the correct format for defining the engineering tasks related to the development of the Email Router system feature that intelligently routes complex inquiries to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) based on content analysis and defined business rules, the tasks should be structured as follows:

1. **Task ID: T001**

5. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Integration with the knowledge base must allow retrieval of relevant information based on email intent.
   - Mechanisms for updating the knowledge base with new information from resolved inquiries must be implemented to enhance future routing accuracy.
6. **Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks
7. **Dependencies:** Successful implementation of content analysis algorithms.

1. **Task ID: T004**
2. **Task Title: Develop Context-Aware Forwarding**
3. **Related User Story:** As a user, I want context-aware forwarding to include relevant metadata and previous correspondence history when routing emails to SMEs for improved response accuracy.
4. **Description:** Design the forwarding mechanism to include relevant metadata and previous correspondence history when routing emails to SMEs. Ensure that context-aware forwarding enhances SME efficiency in understanding inquiries and providing accurate responses.
5. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Design the forwarding mechanism to include relevant metadata and previous correspondence history.
   - Ensure that context-aware forwarding enhances SME efficiency in understanding inquiries and providing accurate responses.
6. **Estimated Effort:** 1 week
7. **Dependencies:** Integration with the routing logic module for seamless forwarding implementation.

1. **Task ID: T005**
2. **Task Title: Test and Validate Routing Functionality**
3. **Related User Story:** As a user, I want thorough testing to validate routing logic and content analysis algorithms for accurate and efficient email routing.
4. **Description:** Create test cases to validate the routing logic and content analysis algorithms for accuracy and efficiency. Conduct thorough testing to ensure that emails are correctly routed to the appropriate SMEs based on defined business rules and content analysis results.
5. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Test cases must be created and executed to validate routing logic and content analysis algorithms.
   - Thorough testing must ensure correct routing of emails to appropriate SMEs based on defined business rules and content analysis results.
6. **Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks
7. **Dependencies:** Completion of all previous tasks for comprehensive testing.
