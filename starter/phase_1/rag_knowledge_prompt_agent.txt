Dear students,
Clara hosts a podcast called Crosscurrents, which explores the intersection of science, culture, and ethics. The show features conversations with researchers, engineers, artists, and activists, addressing topics such as marine ecology, artificial intelligence ethics, climate migration, language preservation, and emerging technologies like retrieval-augmented generation and decentralized identity systems.
